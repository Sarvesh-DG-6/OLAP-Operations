# OLAP-Operations
<br>
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a type of data processing that allows users to interactively examine multidimensional data from different angles.
<br>
It is widely used in business intelligence to support complex queries, reporting, and data analysis.
<br>

# The 5 key OLAP operations are:
<br>
1. Roll-up: This process aggregates data along a dimension. It enables consumers to see data at more abstract levels.
<br>
2. Drill-down: In contrast to roll-up, drill-down enables consumers to see data in greater detail.
<br>
3. Slice: To display a particular subset of the data, this process picks only one dimension from a multidimensional dataset.
<br>
4. Dice: Using dice, you can choose a subset of data by giving precise values or a range across several dimensions.
<br>
5. Pivot (or Rotate): This operation modifies the data cube's dimensional orientation, enabling users to see the data from various angles.
